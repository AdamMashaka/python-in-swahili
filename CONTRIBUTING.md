-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

[](https://gist.github.com/briandk/3d2e8b3ec8daf5a27a62#we-use-github-flow-so-all-code-changes-happen-through-pull-requests)We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  add some codes | changes 
3.  If you've changed code that affect use case, please update the documentation.
4.  Make sure your code lints.
5.  Issue that pull request!

**Note :** make your **pull request** simple and clear, don't add **multiple commits** that are not directly related under one pull request.

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Kalebu/pyswahili/issues/new); it's that easy!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great Bug Reports tend to have:

-   A quick summary and/or background
-   Steps to reproduce
    -   Be specific!
    -   Give sample code if you can. 
-   What you expected would happen
-   What actually happens
-   Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
